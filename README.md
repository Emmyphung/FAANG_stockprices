# FAANG_stockprices

**Data source**: Yahoo

In this project, I extract stock price data of giant tech companies (**Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google**) from Yahoo, from May 18, 2012 (when Facebook had its IPO) to Jan 01, 2020.
This time period witnessed two recent Presidential Elections, Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016. I'm interested in seeing how these special events might have affected the stock market, especially within the tech industry.

The EDA aims to discover general trends of each stock and correlations among the stocks. The two time series analysis notebooks analyzed stock prices of Facebook throughout the period and predict future values as well as growth.

Some findings:
1. Overall, stocks within the FAANG companies are closely correlated. Facebook stocks and Google stocks are the most correlated.
2. Facebook and Google stocks were the most volatile in 2018, which was also the year when Facebook had its infamous scandal with Cambridge Analytica.
3. Facebook and Netflix stocks have the highest prices throughout both election periods.
4. Several tech stocks rocketed after Trump's elecion in 2017.
5. Facebook's stock price has always been increasing since its IPO. It will continue to rise in the next few years.
